 upf2qso.cpp is a program that converts norm-conserving pseudopotentials 
 written in the UPF format (see http://www.pwscf.org) to the 
 www.quantum-simulation.org (QSO) format.

 upf2qso only works for norm-conserving potentials. Ultrasoft potentials
 are not supported

 Test:
 $ src/upf2qso 5.0 < data/C.pz-vbc.UPF > C.pz-vbc.xml
 $ src/upf2qso 8.0 < data/Si.pz-vbc.UPF > Si.pz-vbc.xml
 $ src/upf2qso 8.0 < data/30-Zn.LDA.fhi.UPF > Zn_FHI_LDA.xml

 Additional files v.dat, vlin.dat, upf.dat contain various functions in 
 gnuplot compatible format
