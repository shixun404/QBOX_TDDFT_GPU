 Using Qbox in client-server mode 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Qbox is used in client-server mode by invoking it with the "-server" argument:

$ mpirun -np 32 qb -server qbin qbout 

Qbox starts executing the commands in qbin (if there are any)
Qbox erases the file qbout and writes output to qbout.
When Qbox is done executing commands in file qbin, it creates a file 
named qbin.lock. 
Qbox then waits for the file qbin.lock to disappear.

The client program:
Waits for the file qbin.lock to appear
Reads qbout
Erases qbin
Writes commands on qbin
Removes the file qbin.lock

Testing for the presence of qbin.lock:

In a C/C++ program:
- trying to open the file until the open() call is successful.
- using the stat() function (see man 2 stat).

In a shell script:
- Checking the presence of a file using

 if [[ -a qbin.lock ]]
 then
   ...
 fi

Waiting for the lock file to appear:

 while [[ ! -a qbin.lock ]]
 do
   usleep 500000
 done

In interactive use:

$ cat > qbin
qbox command 1
qbox command 2
^D
$ rm qbin.lock

Using other programming languages (Fortran, etc.):
- trying to open the link and writing to it when successful.
